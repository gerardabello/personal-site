      My name is Gerard Abell√≥ Serras and I&apos;m a software engineer living in
      Barcelona and currently working at{' '}
      <a href="https://www.typeform.com">Typeform</a>. I try to be a
      comprehensive programmer, as no one technology is good for solving all
      problems. I believe good, modern design and quality code are fundamental
      to create excellent software products. I like learning new technologies
      and methods as a way to challenge myself, but it also allows me to face
      problems I could not solve before.
