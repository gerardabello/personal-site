            Barcelona currently working at{' '}
            <a href='https://www.typeform.com'>Typeform</a>. I try to be a
            comprehensive programmer, as no one technology is good for solving
            all problems. I believe good, modern design and quality code are
            fundamental to create excellent software products. I like learning
            new technologies and methods as a way to challenge myself, but it
            also allows me to face problems I could not solve before.
